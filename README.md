# php_room_rental

This is a 2-man team project we did for our PHP class, built with the MVC architecture.

The goal was to for owners of rental rooms to easily put them online and available to potential renters.

it features a small search engine by criteria or keywords and a dynamic calendar to visualize the availability of a room.
